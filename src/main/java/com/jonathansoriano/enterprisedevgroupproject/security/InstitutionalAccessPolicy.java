/**
 * Objective 1, application half: decides whether a verified Clerk token belongs to a
 * student who may use the platform at all.
 *
 * <p>The rule is that the address sits on a {@code .edu} domain — any {@code .edu}, not
 * a list of named schools. That is deliberately broader than the eight seeded
 * universities: a student whose registrar issues an address this project has never
 * heard of should still be able to sign in, and maintaining a per-school allowlist
 * means a code or data change every time the school list moves.
 *
 * <p>This exists because Clerk's own restrictions are configuration on a hosted
 * dashboard, and configuration drifts. Invariant 3 says only verified institutional
 * accounts may post, message or browse; that has to hold whatever state the dashboard
 * is in, so the application checks it on every request rather than trusting that
 * sign-up was restricted. The two halves are complementary, not redundant: Clerk stops
 * the account being created, this stops a token being useful if one was.
 *
 * <p>Fails closed — anything it cannot positively verify is denied.
